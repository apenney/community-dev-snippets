Needs CLA signed

In addition, I notice that we don't have a contributor license agreement on file.  Please sign the CLA as per instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).  Please note, you don't need to print and mail the agreement.  Electronically signing the agreement is sufficient.

The direct link to sign the CLA is: https://cla.puppetlabs.com
