We have a standard format for commit messages to make the git history a bit
clearer when we have to go back and look ad old changes, could you amend the
commit message to look like this?

```
(#issue-number) brief description of the commit

The first paragraph describes the issue that this commit is fixing. While it's
not mandatory, it's good to have this in case the issue is non-obvious or has
some complexity.

The second paragraph describes how this commit fixes the issue. It should
give a brief summary of the fix, and any extra concerns.
```

We have a more complete explanation of this at https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-changes .
