Housekeeping - Commit Message
-----

It would be good to have the commit message amended a little. The first line of the commit should have the issue number and a description of the problem or fix, and the body of the commit message should explain what is this existing behavior and how this change fixes it. We have a more complete explanation of this at https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-changes .
